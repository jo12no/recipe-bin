# recipe-bin
A webapp developed using Flask serving as a personal cooking blog for recipes


This is a small CRUD web app developed to store cooking recipes and photos that my partner and I can use as inspiration when deciding what to cook for the week. It is hosted in Compute Engine in Google Cloud Platform and is publicly accessible: http://34.82.68.111/ 

Users are able to create posts using a WYSIWYG editor with cooking information and upload accompanying images.

The posts can be edited/deleted by the user.

Technologies & components utilised include:
* SQLite/SQLAlchemy
* MVC architecture (models & views) 
* HTML templates & pagination
* Bootstrap for responsive design
* Login sessions 
* Google Cloud Storage (for user uploaded images) 
* Compute Engine (Ubuntu)
